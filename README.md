Ordering system and Mobile apps for Coffee on the go

This code is uploaded in case anyone finds any use whatever out of it. Its a (very) primitive app for ordering coffee 
on a mobile device.

Includes a primitive PHP server (no SQL Schema), client apps for Android & iPhone and an "Order Manager" App.

Obviously I hadn't heard of a "REST router" when I wrote this code. Or a lot of other good ideas.

The code that I wrote is released under Apache license. This includes other code also licensed under MIT or Apache and
it is not my intent to change or re-license any of that code.

This did undergo a successful test in Los Angeles at a coffee shop but we couldn't get any further traction and
abandoned the project.

Apologies, this is my first PHP, Android *and* iOS App all on one !

If anyone does find anything whatever of use here, I'd love to hear about it at: nick.a.ambrose@gmail.com
